#trip planer
Simple console program for "tripping" between cities (destinations).
Methods of linked list is used for adding and iterator is used for the iteration from one
city to next following and backwards.
At the start of the program user has to input city as for starting point.
Adding cities after the first one is possible only if no duplication occur. If a city is added

starting point (city). Exceptions are not handled still.
